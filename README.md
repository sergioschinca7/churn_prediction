# This time I make a churn prediction on credit card customers.

# churn_prediction

Churn prediction can help one to foresee if the person is leaving so that you can have adequate time to prepare strategies to engage them.Fr instance, in the area of HR, there are always a group of employees who tender their resignations even though they are doing well and the company wants to retain them. However, it is always too late to retain them as they have already been accepted of a better job offering by another company. Hence, why do we not engage the staff even before they start looking for other job opportunities? This is where Employee Churn Prediction comes into play.

# About Dataset

I got this dataset from a website with URL as https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
This dataset contains features of 10000 customers.

# Code

I predict customer churn with an artificial neural network model that identifies customers who are going to churn.
In this model I got a f1-score = 0.92.
Next step would be tunning hyperparameters to reach better accuracy and recall, it is mean better f1-score.
